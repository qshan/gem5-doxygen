<p>It is recommended reading for anyone who wants to understand <a class="el" href="namespaceMinor.html" title="Minor contains all the definitions within the MinorCPU apart from the CPU class itself. ">Minor</a>'s internal organisation, design decisions, C++ implementation and Python configuration. A familiarity with gem5 and some of its internal structures is assumed. This document is meant to be read alongside the <a class="el" href="namespaceMinor.html" title="Minor contains all the definitions within the MinorCPU apart from the CPU class itself. ">Minor</a> source code and to explain its general structure without being too slavish about naming every function and data type.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="whatis"></a>
What is Minor?</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="namespaceMinor.html" title="Minor contains all the definitions within the MinorCPU apart from the CPU class itself. ">Minor</a> is an in-order processor model with a fixed pipeline but configurable data structures and execute behaviour. It is intended to be used to model processors with strict in-order execution behaviour and allows visualisation of an instruction's position in the pipeline through the MinorTrace/minorview.py format/tool. The intention is to provide a framework for micro-architecturally correlating the model with a particular, chosen processor with similar capabilities.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="philo"></a>
Design philosophy</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mt"></a>
Multithreading</h2>
<p>The model isn't currently capable of multithreading but there are THREAD comments in key places where stage data needs to be arrayed to support multithreading.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="structs"></a>
Data structures</h2>
<p>Decorating data structures with large amounts of life-cycle information is avoided. Only instructions (<a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1MinorDynInst.html" title="Dynamic instruction for Minor. ">MinorDynInst</a>) contain a significant proportion of their data content whose values are not set at construction.</p>
<p>All internal structures have fixed sizes on construction. Data held in queues and FIFOs (<a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1MinorBuffer.html" title="TimeBuffer with MinorTrace and Named interfaces. ">MinorBuffer</a>, <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1FUPipeline.html" title="A functional unit configured from a MinorFU object. ">FUPipeline</a>) should have a <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1BubbleIF.html" title="Interface class for data with &#39;bubble&#39; values. ">BubbleIF</a> interface to allow a distinct 'bubble'/no data value option for each type.</p>
<p>Inter-stage 'struct' data is packaged in structures which are passed by value. Only <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1MinorDynInst.html" title="Dynamic instruction for Minor. ">MinorDynInst</a>, the line data in <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1ForwardLineData.html" title="Line fetch data in the forward direction. ">ForwardLineData</a> and the memory-interfacing objects <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Fetch1_1_1FetchRequest.html" title="Memory access queuing. ">Fetch1::FetchRequest</a> and <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ_1_1LSQRequest.html" title="Derived SenderState to carry data access info. ">LSQ::LSQRequest</a> are '::new' allocated while running the model.</p>

<p>Memory operation instructions traverse their functional units to perform their EA calculations. On 'commit', the ExecContext::initiateAcc execution phase is performed and any memory access is issued (via. <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1ExecContext.html" title="ExecContext bears the exec_context interface for Minor. ">ExecContext</a>::{read,write}Mem calling <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html#a18594a4baa4eef7bfc3be45c03f4d544" title="Single interface for readMem/writeMem/amoMem to issue requests into the LSQ. ">LSQ::pushRequest</a>) to the <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html">LSQ</a>.</p>
<p>Note that faults are issued as if they are instructions and can (currently) be issued to <em>any</em> functional unit.</p>
<p>Every issued instruction is also pushed into the Execute::inFlightInsts queue. Memory ref. instructions are pushing into Execute::inFUMemInsts queue.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="commit"></a>
Commit</h3>
<p>Instructions are committed by examining the head of the Execute::inFlightInsts queue (which is decorated with the functional unit number to which the instruction was issued). Instructions which can then be found in their functional units are executed and popped from Execute::inFlightInsts.</p>
<p>Memory operation instructions are committed into the memory queues (as described above) and exit their functional unit pipeline but are not popped from the Execute::inFlightInsts queue. The Execute::inFUMemInsts queue provides ordering to memory operations as they pass through the functional units (maintaining issue order). On entering the <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html">LSQ</a>, instructions are popped from Execute::inFUMemInsts.</p>
<p>If the parameter executeAllowEarlyMemoryIssue is set, memory operations can be sent from their FU to the <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html">LSQ</a> before reaching the head of Execute::inFlightInsts but after their dependencies are met. <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1MinorDynInst.html#ac72a9dcff570bbaf24da9ee74392e6d0" title="execSeqNum of the latest inst on which this inst depends. ">MinorDynInst::instToWaitFor</a> is marked up with the latest dependent instruction execSeqNum required to be committed for a memory operation to progress to the <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html">LSQ</a>.</p>
<p>Once a memory response is available (by testing the head of Execute::inFlightInsts against <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html#a458abe5d220a0f66600bf339bceb2100" title="Returns a response if it&#39;s at the head of the transfers queue and it&#39;s either complete or can be sent...">LSQ::findResponse</a>), commit will process that response (ExecContext::completeAcc) and pop the instruction from Execute::inFlightInsts.</p>
<p>Any branch, fault or interrupt will cause a stream sequence number change and signal a branch to Fetch1/Fetch2. Only instructions with the current stream sequence number will be issued and/or committed.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="advance"></a>
Advance</h3>
<p>All non-stalled pipeline are advanced and may, thereafter, become stalled. Potential activity in the next cycle is signalled if there are any instructions remaining in any pipeline.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sb"></a>
Scoreboard</h3>
<p>The scoreboard (<a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Scoreboard.html" title="A scoreboard of register dependencies including, for each register: The number of in-flight instructi...">Scoreboard</a>) is used to control instruction issue. It contains a count of the number of in flight instructions which will write each general purpose CPU integer or float register. Instructions will only be issued where the scoreboard contains a count of 0 instructions which will write to one of the instructions source registers.</p>
<p>Once an instruction is issued, the scoreboard counts for each destination register for an instruction will be incremented.</p>
<p>The estimated delivery time of the instruction's result is marked up in the scoreboard by adding the length of the issued-to FU to the current time. The timings parameter on each FU provides a list of additional rules for calculating the delivery time. These are documented in the parameter comments in MinorCPU.py.</p>
<p>On commit, (for memory operations, memory response commit) the scoreboard counters for an instruction's source registers are decremented. will be decremented.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="ifi"></a>
Execute::inFlightInsts</h3>
<p>The Execute::inFlightInsts queue will always contain all instructions in flight in <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Execute.html" title="Execute stage. ">Execute</a> in the correct issue order. <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Execute.html#af0b90170a273f1a0d41f4164ba3fe456" title="Try and issue instructions from the inputBuffer.

LSQ</h3>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html">LSQ</a> can support multiple outstanding transactions to memory in a number of conservative cases.</p>
<p>There are three queues to contain requests: requests, transfers and the store buffer. The requests and transfers queue operate in a similar manner to the queues in <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Fetch1.html" title="A stage responsible for fetching &quot;lines&quot; from memory and passing them to Fetch2. ">Fetch1</a>. The store buffer is used to decouple the delay of completing store operations from following loads.</p>
<p>Requests are issued to the DTLB as their instructions leave their functional unit. At the head of requests, cacheable load requests can be sent to memory and on to the transfers queue. Cacheable stores will be passed to transfers unprocessed and progress that queue maintaining order with other transactions.</p>
<p>The conditions in <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ.html#a7d7b8ddc7c69fd9eb3b8594fe261d8e8" title="Try and issue a memory access for a translated request at the head of the requests queue...">LSQ::tryToSendToTransfers</a> dictate when requests can be sent to memory.</p>
<p>All uncacheable transactions, split transactions and locked transactions are processed in order at the head of requests. Additionally, store results residing in the store buffer can have their data forwarded to cacheable loads (removing the need to perform a read from memory) but no cacheable load can be issue to the transfers queue until that queue's stores have drained into the store buffer.</p>
<p>At the end of transfers, requests which are <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1LSQ_1_1LSQRequest.html#a429d50f5dd6be4217d5dba93f8c289d3a81b9dbf6670e396d0266949d59b57428">LSQ::LSQRequest::Complete</a> (are faulting, are cacheable stores, or have been sent to memory and received a response) can be picked off by <a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Execute.html" title="Execute stage.

<p><a class="el" href="classBarrier.html">Barrier</a> instructions do not prevent cacheable loads from progressing to memory but do cause a stream change which will discard that load.

MinorTrace and minorview.py</h1>
<p>The debug flag MinorTrace causes cycle-by-cycle state data to be printed which can then be processed and viewed by the minorview.py tool. This output is very verbose and so it is recommended it only be used for small examples.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="traceformat"></a>
MinorTrace format</h2>
<p>There are three types of line outputted by MinorTrace:</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="state"></a>
MinorTrace - Ticked unit cycle state</h3>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"> 110000: system.cpu.dcachePort: MinorTrace: state=MemoryRunning in_tlb_mem=0/0
</pre><p>For each time step, the MinorTrace flag will cause one MinorTrace line to be printed for every named element in the model.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="traceunit"></a>
MinorInst - summaries of instructions issued by     Decode</h3>
<p><a class="el" href="classMinor_1_1Decode.html">Decode</a></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"> 140000: system.cpu.execute: MinorInst: id=0/1.1/1/1.1 addr=0x5c \
                             inst="  mov r0, #0" class=IntAlu

  --start-time time     time of first event to load from file
  --end-time time       time of last event to load from file
  --mini-views          show tiny views of the next 10 time steps
</pre><p>Raw debugging output can be passed to minorview.py as the event-file. It will pick out the MinorTrace lines and use other lines where units in the simulation are named (such as system.cpu.dcachePort in the above example) will appear as 'comments' when units are clicked on the visualiser.</p>
<p>Clicking on a unit which contains instructions or lines will bring up a speech bubble giving extra information derived from the MinorInst/MinorLine lines.</p>
<p>&ndash;start-time and &ndash;end-time allow only sections of debug files to be loaded.</p>
<p>&ndash;prefix allows the name prefix of the CPU to be inspected to be supplied. This defaults to 'system.cpu'.</p>
